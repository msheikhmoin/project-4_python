# Question 03====

# Sophia has a fruit store. She has written a function num_in_stock which takes a string fruit as a parameter and returns how many of that fruit are in her inventory. Write code in main() which will:

# Prompt the user to enter a fruit ("Enter a fruit: ")

# # Print the number which are in stock if Sophia has that fruit in her inventory (there are more than 0 in stock)

# # Here's two sample runs of the program (user input in bold italics):

# Enter a fruit: pear

# # 1000

# # This fruit is not in stock.



def main():
	fruit : str = input("Enter a fruit: ")
	stock = num_in_stock(fruit)
	if stock == 0:
		print("This fruit is not in stock.")
	else:
		print("This fruit is in stock! Here is how many:")
		print(stock)
def num_in_stock(fruit):
	"""
	This function returns the number of fruit Sophia has in stock.
	"""
	if fruit == 'apple':
		return 2
	if fruit == 'durian':
		return 4
	if fruit == 'pear':
		return 1000
	else:
		return 0
