# Question 00=====

# There are times where we want to return different things from a function based on some condition. To practice this idea, imagine that we want to check if someone is an adult. We might check their age and return different things depending on how old they are!

#Here are two sample runs of the program, one for each return option (user input in bold italics):

# (Entered age is an adult age)

# How old is this person?: 35

# True

# (Entered age is not an adult age)

# How old is this person?: 7
#
# False



ADULT_AGE : int = 18 # U.S. age 

def is_adult(age: int):
    if age >= ADULT_AGE:
        return True
    
    return False
def main():
    age : str = int(input("How old is this person?: "))
    print(is_adult(age))
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
