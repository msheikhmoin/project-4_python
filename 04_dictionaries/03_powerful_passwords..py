# Question 03====

# You want to be safe online and use different passwords for different websites. However, you are forgetful at times and want to make a program that can match which password belongs to which website without storing the actual password!

# # For example, using a hash function called SHA256(...) something as simple as

# # can be hashed into a much more complex

# ## (Hint. You will need to use the provided hash_password(...) function. You don't necessarily need to know how it works, just know that hash_password(...)
#  returns the hash for the password!)
